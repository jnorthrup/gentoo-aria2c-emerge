# aria2c for gentoo

run 16 sockets on any and all gentoo mirrors at once, because sometimes you just fucking live in asia.

##enablement:

the first thing you need is mirrors.  1 is a minimum.

mirrorselect -i 

## install
there is an ebuild.  any help with that is greatly appreciated.  

once you have the script, run garia2c.bash install as root, of course.
